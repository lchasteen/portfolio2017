          <h2>Experience</h2>
           <p>I am not new to programming; I started coding 15 years ago as a hobby.  
		  A lot of the work that I do now is centered around web and software component development.
		  Take some time to look at my portfolio and see some of the work that I have done.  Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
